# hello-world
This is Jeremie's first time using Git. 
I recently completed Peace Corps service in China and have 5 years of experience developing partnerships for short-term projects and long-term programs. I'm enthusiastic about crafting robust cross-functional collaborations, building relationships through strategic outreach, and creating support content to facilitate new opportunities, generate space for innovation and drive success. I'm passionate about diversity and inclusion and embed these sensitivities in all aspects of my work.
